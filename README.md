# The Russian Agent, Svletlano Ruoschkovos

The agent follows these steps to 
"hack" his target's vehicle.
- Collect geospatial information on 
vehicle through a channel available 
to him, that he thinks is accurate.
- Use available resources and known
methodologies to "hack the system":
air conditioning, radio, gps, 
bluetooth,electronic brake system, 
etc.
- Maintain connectivity to the exploit successfully enacted.
- Profit from exploits.

Some styles are preferred by Svletlano due to his background and present circumstances.
- Operates under the orders of his regime, such as by playing "Mr. Good Cop" or "Sir Liberator" to people at his mercy that have been oppressed and terrorized by his regime, in order to gather information on the targets and serve as a secret liability to them.
- Employs thugs, crooked cops, and paramilitary for accessories such as magic mushrooms, methamphetamine, cocktail death penalty drugs, firearms, and valuable information on the target/s.
- Employs the services of ex-military torturers, blond whores, and disenfranchised black people in the United States to "work towards Eastern imperial agenda".
- Presents himself as a soft-spoken sensible man with a knack for offering poetic advice and whisperings to those he targeted for seduction and infiltration, while harboring personal hatred that he outwardly expresses as diplomacy and friendship. Does not like to talk too much about politics and race, but when he is asked, he responds that he is a Marxist-Leninist.
- Frequently employs free-for-all and domination strategy. Track record of his success demonstrates cunning styles of gaits used to falsely befriend, compromise, and eliminate his targets as well as any of his involved allies that he assume to be liabilities.
- Architects race/resource wars between his different allies to pilfer power from them and redirect power from other channels to him. He does these things while playing the voice of reason, guardian of the peace, and bringer of eternal salvation.
- Tells people that ask him of his occupation that he is an office clerk so that they never suspect him to be the head of multi-billion dollar vehicle-hacking operations.
- Devotes more of his time during recent years on Red team hacking operations, and does not have the proper background knowledge to understand advanced technology. Rather plunders then purchases advanced technology for his personal engineers to enhance into weaponized forms.
- Constantly practices pop cultural conservative mannerisms in the mirror to blend in with foreign leadership, but enjoys activities such as philandering, hard drugs, and demon-worshipping.
- Makes up elaborate but identical fallacious stories to tell his many secret foreign fiances on how he obtained his narco-ballistic wealth.
- Practices foresight in developing plans to "siphon" his unusual forms of wealth, such as narco-ballistic wealth, into more civil malice such as "cybersecurity".
- Employs aggressive advertisers to market his "cybersecurity" en masse to automobile retailers. Adds services unit to perform cyber-retro enhancements on the older vehicles. Guarantees that products are real-time with solar-powered energy.
- Foments institutional idolatry to lure the prone and uncentered away from their pre-selected ideal paths, carefully tracks their progression in idolatry, and dissipates their wealth and social power when he sees fit, such as when he is desperate for resources, leaving them broken and delusional.
- Uses his national identity's rich history of "Nu Historicism", especially on the aspect of fabricated accounting, to really make a difference in cultural identities, ideologies, and perhaps other ethno-cultural aspects in countries that are geographically far from his homeland.
- Uses techniques such as paranoia induction (through over-surveillance, maladaptive/harmful human resources arrangements, etc.) and symbolic warfaring expressionism to maintain his grasp on his ever-expanding dominion.
- Maintains hegemony over Kompramatpopulizhei Krafschkatz, databases upon databases of compromising information on millions of people throughout the world, so as to etch the same horrors onto those he considers enemies, and applying that compromising information onto virtually everyone else as political leverage, a declaration of his influence that should very very seldom ever be questioned.
- Is open to using secretive forms of chemical warfare against those he classified as enemies, with aims ranging from maiming them, to drugging them, to harassing and stupefying them.
- Coordinates seriously terroristic messages, usually involving extortion or alarms of mass destruction, through his proxies in order to hold down socioeconomic competition and conserve his status as a powerful overlord.
- Oversees divisions between Maurya and Farsia, and enjoys chiming in as a bridge of diplomacy, in exchange to also be a benefactor of resources between the two regions.
- Prefers to maintain either a neutral or domineering position in BRICS trade arrangements that may be questionable by some organizations' standards.
- Uses the effects of the Arab Spring as a political opportunity to trade his employees as labor to Egyptians for their use of his provided internet-enabled technologies that may be completely radio-based. Places high emphasis on being the only supplier of militaristic technologies to certain Egyptians. Installs vulnerabilities in the systems, but says that it is for defense purposes in the cases of particular situations.
- Colludes with agents from the Permanent 5 members of UNSC, in order to ensure constant flow of wealth and health to his family members, a great fraction of them being aristocrats.
- Hires Russian domestic intelligentsia to collude with right-wing Western academics in conducting sociological research on demographics of curiosity, such as Arabia, Farsia, Maurya, and Indochina.
- Collaborates with East Germans and Muslim Turks to "kneecap" engineering and innovation in regions of potential competition, such as South China, Korea, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.
- First made his name, "made his bones", to get to where he is at by killing narco-ballistic informants such as the Afghan Georgian Marcos Hishmael.
- Practices the frequent tactic of luring women of his attraction, mainly of Greco/Spanisha descent to use powerful hallucinogenic drugs in the woods of Latin America, killing them, and blaming the indigenous peoples there so as to start a resource war with them fought by reddish behind him.
- Educates his children in his ways through the projection of his image from himself to them, such as by making them read books he wrote called "Micro-Managing a Foreign Land Through Ransomware", "To Rule a Ransomed Nation", etc.
- Continually stays in contact with Sikh separatists that serve as sowers of destruction and disgrace in the form of spies against British-Mauryan unity.
- Stole blueprints of naval technology from the British through coordinated DDOS attacks launched from his network of hacked vehicles. Used the blueprints to found competing corporations against post-"East India Company" corporations run by the British. Causes food prices to skyrocket in the UK.
- Orders Southern Black types to wear really strong laundry detergent and French perfumes to "arouse and treat guests of honor from competing lands such as China, Japan, and Saudi Arabia", knowing that the odors are super-effectively offensive to those groups.
- Calls for "common enemy watching/hunting" schematics through the engineering of dragnetted social situations.
- Floods the legal court systems of foreign nations with reports of criminal/terrorist evidence through automation powered by illegally obtained information (such as hacked data).
- Hacked German engineering corporations for firestorm-producing technologies, and coerces Chinese villages to mass-produce the firestorming weapons for his armies.
- Calls for collective unity and individual responsibility in foreign lands where he offers services to their cause by serving in their limited liability government.
- Relocates entire indigenous villagers to lands so foreign to them that they go mad (most likely due to some kind of poisoning from the elements on the new lands), and brags about the effects to Western leaders so as to encourage them to enact those same policies of relocation and psychological experimentation on "strange peoples" in the name of nationalization.
- Ordered Russian nationals to relocate to Spain to startup colonies there as bases for influence campaigns against countries such as Italy and the United States.
- No longer observes American or Chinese media due to adultery by some of his fiances from the two countries. Utilizes jealousy of lands with better economies by channeling it outwards as altruistic,collectivistic, and ideological goodwill.
- Buys large swathes of land in Latin America, and efficiently rations out capital to pay bio-engineers with prestigious backgrounds, such as Ivy League education, enough for trade secrets that yield more and better crops than his Chinese or US farming competitors.
- Likes to stay noble-minded, but does veer off course from his planned path he calls holy. Some suspected activities he has done include murdering one of his fiances named Konstaney Whuveskos after the revelation of her homosexuality, and selling another one of his fiances Delauney de la Montegue into African bondage after alleging of her affairs with narco-traders and foreign militarists.
- Enjoys deluding and manipulating senile Westerners in powerful positions, so that he does not have to expend as much capital or effort for they are to do his bidding. Exemplar of capital management, resource efficiency, and optimization expertise.
- Fabricates birth certificates, college degrees, and other documents to enable espionage groups such as those connected to the Saudis and Malays.
- Tends to be extremely receptive to social anomalies that may lead to objective entanglement and economical/moral trappings, in such a degree as to rarely ever be swindled or deceived, especially in situations with dangerous apparatusses such as noxious gas and firearms. On the rare occasions that he does, he turns to Western psychology expert types (mainly from Spain due to his genocultural sharings with many there) such as Joseph Navarro. (@ https://www.jnforensics.com/post/are-you-being-manipulated-by-a-social-puppeteer)
- Masters every new cutting-edge technique such as confusion/reflective/amplification cyber attacks. Applied these techniques to persons he singled out. Educates his children and the youth on the effectiveness of these ways under his guidance, demonstrated by the sorry,deplorable, and dysfunctionally ruined persons affected by his cyberattacks.
- Discovers more ways of utilizing his state-sponsored internet troll farms through material provided by the expertise of Western Corporate agents. (@ https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/psychology-online-trolling-understanding-dealing-negative-simanta) Wires money to persons with H1-B visas for them to "troll", "stalk", "slander", and "defame" natives by referencing hacked data records.
- Encourages "post-racial integration for unification campaigns" to foreign leaders, by way of verbal speech. Hacks payroll systems so that some people make more money because of their "race","ethnicity", or "gender". Blames the foreign leaders for incompetence and ultra-right bigotry.
- Enjoys raining on certain persons' parades such as by ordering Hispanic,Arab, and Malaysian men to pursue Chinese women, as well as concocting allegations of terrorism, disruption, and disgrace conducted by individuals labelled threat actors (primarily from Japan, Siberia, Israel, and Saudi Arabia) that constitute the most extreme forms of anarchy many would say are blasphemous and/or treasonous.
- Buys a duopolistic stake in emerging computing products. Outsources AI training that uses hacked data from US tech corporations to Indians, Malaysians, and Pakistanis after those groups were sent home from the US, Spain, and Mexico due to their work visa expiration.  Kills Cuban criminals, and shifts blame to the specific Indian, Malaysian, or Pakistani persons so they never step foot in the US,Spain, or Mexico again.
- Garroted Josiah Klevhinger to the point of decapitation on suspicions of being a narco-informant for Interpol and obstructionist between him and Brazil.
- Sends Chinese agents to flood-infiltrate organizations such as Interpol, The Atlantic, New York Times, and South China Morning Post. Compromises these agents by selling their hacked information to ISIS, Hamas, and Taliban splinters in exchange for raw resources.
- Gave the counter-terrorists Oschwaldi Samuels and Jack Thirwall supplementary material to rob and persecute those not in their religious sects.
- Used a Russian shotgun made with Chinese steel to blow a hole in the head of Enrico Emiliano Rauscalli, a Russian leader that was a peasant from Western Russia before his promotion to an underground caporegimente.
- Barters with Filipino businessmen based in the Philippines to ditch IT products from the USA in favor for less hacked and cheaper versions from Russian corporations that he sponsors.
- Gave Adamicci de Sackler-Rioux millions of pharmaceutical pills to drug any women of his choice, as well as to profit from the excess capital through dealing it in the streets of Rome.
- Enjoys casual sexual relations with women such as twin Irish/Spaniard receptionists he hired, named Karly and Judy Leeds, for one of his small businesses.
- Continually leaks top-secret locations, technologies, and organizational details on the Japanese Defense Forces to China. At United Nations meetings, blames Taiwan for the hacks.
- Orders the Chinese to produce designer drugs of his formulae in bulk. Experiments those drugs on Japanese, Mexican, and Samoan immigrants banished from their homelands.
- Hacks advanced semiconductor technologies from Taiwan, and sells them over to Vietnam. Demands the Vietnamese use only wooden pipes, wooden factories to mass-produce the semiconductors at a cheaper price per unit. Sells Chinese rubble to the Vietnamese for factory fuel at twice the price he got it.
-  Makes engines, foodstuffs, guns, databases and other items with far greater quality and price for Arabians due to what he claims is a more empathetic understanding of Islamic culture than what the USA has to offer.
-  Funds questionable business/commercial interests of the American Psychiatric Association by pushing for more Russian consumption of pharmaceuticals from the United States, Germany, and South Korea in exchange for at least a 35% cut of their profits.
-  Always open to big medicine opportunities from places such as China and India that produce some drugs at much cheaper prices than the USA.
-  Learned about Mongolian biological agents used in their military campaigns through a book passed down to him by his great-grandfather. Immediately commercializes the knowledge, and sells it to the Chinese for twice the normal market price.
-  Uses automated hacking tools provided by East German defectors to steal accurate information, and sell that information to governments of interest so that he has stakes in their "democratic knowledge", which consists of gossip, legal/technical drafts, and encrypted messages.
-  Took a long French rapier several times into a Muslim in a former USSR state due to evidence that they were a terrorist, and offers heartful apologies for his violent and forced actions after receiving a medal for his heroics. Claims that it was not a hate crime since he does not observe religion or nationality, and that the individual had a long track record of swindling people, cyberbullying people, desecrating Christian churches, raping French women, etc. Tells his fiances he is a celebrated hero in all former USSR states.
-  Likens himself to a beacon of peace and stability in a violent and chaotic world encouraged by fuels of hate and deceit. Takes hours per month rehearsing the same lines of poetic reasoning on his justness to his many foreign fiances.
-  Shies away from the strongman persona since he does not like to appear as unvulnerable. One of his greatest strengths is in devising trappings for his vulnerabilities with the aims to capture and cripple his surprise-assailants. Tells his admirers he got to where he is at by experiencing unnecessary pains and labors, but that it is necessary because of the balance between state and God. Really plays the path of humility to appease the layman and deter potential assassins that strike out of red-blooded jealous hate planned. Tells the youth that they should work smarter so that they are happier and Frenchier than him, but that they will always be Russian till the days they die, whether they like it or not.
-  Pushes for a kind of Russian orthodoxy that intrudes his ideological offenses into other people's mental and physical dominions. Handsomely pays East German defectors, those desperate for cash with a hate at least equal to that of a slave for a rapist of a master, all kinds of currency for them to popularize his cultural and socio-economic ethno-national views onto lands outside of what he calls the homeland.
-  Hires prostitutes from Spain to entrench and dragnet targets in Western countries such as Australia, Ireland, and the United States. Common tactics by these hired hands include using oblivious targets as "mules" and "dummies" in drug trafficking, robberies, and government-fixing, and then throwing them to the police or rich criminal-aristocrats for exploitation.
-  Developed a grudge against Robber Kanaddy. Spontaneously went over to the man's house one night, held a Russian shotgun 3 inches from his face, and blew his head off. Later told police investigators that Robber Kanaddy had an oxycodone, heroin, fentanyl, and cartel problem, so it was expected.
-  Utilizes the moral and financial depravity of certain South Asian immigrants by paying them extra to serve as "spies for the rightful Eastern domain against Western influence".
-  Manipulates the fear and dramatics of far-right Italians, deters them away from Russia by way of violence, so that they move westward to the United States, where they push for fascism and genocide in their new homes against what they state as injustices against them in their Russian interactions.
-  Sells camera backdoors to Chinese intelligence, and blames poor USA human resources and security. Proliferates terroristic techniques, malbureaucratic status, and details on successful subversion/aggravation campaigns to disgruntled, disenfranchised groups in the West that he suspects harbor fatal animosity towards Westerners. Common customers for this information he sells include Mexicans, Saudis, Vietnamese, and Brazilians. For an extra fee, he also provides physical auxiliary support for them to violently/unjustly act on the sold information.
-  Perservering interest in gathering and utilizing information on global dissidents with potential of mass organization and revolt.
-  Invents new political techniques to contain and manipulate those of his interests. Actively applies secrecy to the practice of his techniques. Claims moral and intellectual superiority to Western intellects that have to "coin their idea" to be successful enough to make a living.
-  Took a political science course at Yale University on Southeast Asian politics. Travels to Southeast Asia to grow a Russian influence there based on shared ideological histories, anti-imperialism, and the love of misery in company. Sells hacked Android communication applications at discounted prices to them so that there is real-time connectivity. Peacefully leaves after establishing tributary state payment schedules.
-  Grows Chinese e-commerce giants in Cambodia to make Vietnam jealous. Ambushes and kills Vietnamese units that invaded Cambodia to stop Chinese e-commerce giants, and tells the Cambodians that the Chinese did the killing so that they switch over to Russian e-commerce giants.
-  Funds Chinese immigration to the United States to target,pervert, and overthrow non-European established immigrants, such as Mexicans, Vietnamese, Cubans,and Arabs. Relays to these Chinese immigrants who to stalk and persecute, and how, such as by raising housing prices, using threats of violence or law&order, and random search&confiscation. When there are complaints, he engineers the scapegoating of the Democratic Party and West Germans, so that they are the ones that pay the bills.
-  Pays Western politicians money in the form of women, opium, and oil (electronic currency transfers prohibited) to "send back Easterners unnaturally living in the West home never to return".
-  Once disemboweled a Chinese man using a Japanese blade. Told his close friends and family that it felt terrible and barbaric, and that he would rather use poison because it prolongs the suffering of the victims.
-  Introduces advanced electronic signal-jamming technologies to the West after systematically eliminating competing defense contractors. Persuades Western leadership to use electronic signal-jamming campaigns en masse against marginalized citizens, and ensures that he would "intervene in foreign affairs" if there are any outcries from the victims.
-  Does not like to think of himself as a ruthless criminal since he has numerous foreign fiances. Prioritizes cleanliness in "black flag operations" such as narco-distribution by systematic elimination centering around the lower castes or suspected threats in general.
-  Has studied the practice of American apologism in historical till modern times. Invents a new Russian Romantic Expressionism that fuses American apologism with Hindicized Nietzschism, and the product is moral reflection but without the acknowledgment of immorality. He rationalizes that this preference in cultural movements is because acknowledgment of fault defeats purposes of brighter days under a planned Russian future.
-  Surveils disgruntled Westerners that have been fed up and broken, without the appetite to appease former wants. Capitalizes on American apologetic practices such as trophy-wiving, popstar coverage, government handouts, Nu demonization, labor camps, and integration for unification campaigns that have been put into effect in ways he judges to be most wrongful due to the soured attitudes of the disgruntled Westerners. Encourages these Westerners to dissent, privately militarize, and generate capital for future Russia in response to "sins and failures of the system".
-  Enjoys witnessing tragedies of Westerners caused by his luring them into precarious situations or decision-making that jeopardizes other Westerners he views as threats, whether greater or lesser. Uses items such as valuable raw materials (gold, rare earth metals) and cryptocurrency to "ensure the promise of a better tomorrow" for the beguiled Westerners to lay ruin to themselves.
-  Actively avoids using dichotomous terms in public. Allegations of his bipartisanness,two-facedness are deflected by his response that it was the Persians, through Manichean philosophy, that unlawfully pressured him into appearing as a despotic dividor. Announces to the general public that he does not like to play the game of divide-and-conquer, but that he will always be the one that cracks and hacks last.
-  Maintains knowledge of underlying sources of discontent between dualists from different cultures, such as Daoism, Manicheanism, and Cartesian duality. Does not reluct to encourage race/culture/empire wars between these dualists, who are primarily one of Vietnamese+Chinese, French, or Arabian alignment. Scavenges for resources and technologies left over from the fighting, and uses it to build "better Russian versions for the rightful dominance by Russia". Calls the Vietnamese+Chinese,French, and Arabians dimwitted anarcho-idiots for their losses engineered by him.
-  Reads about the high rates of tourism in the United States of America and Japan. Sends ethnic Turks from the former USSR states in colonies to the United States. Does the same with Japan except sends Poles, Lithuanians, and Germanic bastards there instead. Writes tens of pages of rationales on why this strategy will "ensure a more defensive Russia for now and the future by contaminating the genetic and ideological makeup of two of the biggest nation-state enemies".
-  Politically weaponizes crises and disasters in other nations. Funds criminals to "rob and eat the upper-middle class and make the lower classes worship high-culture idols". Takes precautions not to reveal himself as a great motivator of class warfare in enemy states, such as the EU and USA. Relays events of class warfare from enemy states back to Russia as proof of capitalist exploitation, hypocrisy, malvertising, and robber-baron governments, all much more wrongful than the counterparts in Russia. When the masses cheer him on, he says it is his responsibility to proselytize the truth, even if it coincides with his Russian allegiance.
-  Does not want to proliferate "new players" in less developed countries, especially if that will disrupt and dispossess him of ongoing Russian arms/Russian corporate tech deals. Instead, dons a stance and forward in the name of diplomacy and "targeted democraticization" of dangerous producers. Somehow manages to convince "new players" to turn around, go home, and never try again in some things. Redirects relevant media, communications, and other social resources away from suspected "new players" to obstracize them by way of "hang them out to dry till death for Apollo".
-  Uses his mastery of lawfare and middleman attacks to act as a legitimate buffer between two ends of what he considers to be a dichotomy. Acts as a bettor with the moral to not be tied to any morals. Usually favors weak agents that have stronger privileges over the weaker-privileged, or agents stronger than those with stronger privileges. He prefers these options due to aims of igniting maximally downturning change against those he believes to be enemies, through the agents he supports for malicious ends. Typical roles for his middleman attacks include USA-Japan, Mexico-China, Phillipines-Laos, Catholics-Buddhists, Catholics-Protestants, and Proletariat-Plebian. Enjoys lending "Godfather" and financial support to his enemies after he secretly worked to bar and mark them for them to reach such vulnerable states. Has relative impulse control in matters of plagiarizing/confiscating the labor/possession of others, but those that have crossed him before usually find little luck in a living future without his affliction.
-  Globally markets his cybersecurity and commercial militaries, even to his enemies. Declares to everyone he is a fair person that does not discriminate, and also believes in the faith of peace and love. Offers credible accounts, judgments free of political influence, and non-opportunistic support. Claims the rapid growth and success of his big security is because he is fair and accepts everyone, as he says, "unlike some countries like the USA that practices apartheid".
-  Maintains steadfast views when his opinions are questioned. Has full and honest knowledge on what he believes to be fact or his opinion, and openly tells people about this so that they are not misled into believing he is an idiot.
-  Enjoys witnessing the rapid deterioration of social arrangements regarding those he thinks are enemies, after encouraging state-sponsored yellow journalism and dropping "bombshell revelations". One of his favorite themes is the encouragement of senile, deluded old ones to cede title, power, and resources to cheats, liars, and sycophants that have always been cushioned enough to never go a day in genuine torment or disappointment due to what he believes to be the lack of humanity in those types. Claims that he always does business and politics both fair and fitting with those that he propped up, even if they are individually flawed beyond the general public's belief.
-  Reads that the USA has an accounting problem ever since blockchain and the pandemic. Offers to send "the best and brightest Russians to the USA, the smartest immigrants ever, to help with the math problems caused by less established citizens."
-  Offers advice to what he calls "ailing American institutions". Instructs them that the social order they should work for is 10 routes of social programs for every route to gold. Says that it is for the better, and that gold is meaningless when compared to the ever-omnipotent power of human sensibility.
-  Sometimes suffers moral qualms from applying force onto the social order in the sense of pressure travelling along an unhinged chain. Sometimes believes he is evil, but after conversing with his numerous foreign fiances with their many opinions, he recollects them all equally and concludes that he must be a full and good person.
-  Deploys "sightseering units" to foreign lands so that they proliferate their "predictions" on what futures await for some people. Three favorite countries of his for this activity are the United Arab Emirates, the United States of America, and large swathes of Chinese and Indochinese territory. A frequent instruction for the "sightseering units" is to "help clear up all the misunderstanding to close the loopholes to maladaptive cycles, and then to join hands with Russia in establishing longer lasting and more integral cycles not dictated by the circustry of East-West commercial malignment". Sightseering units tend to use methods of operations such as lie replacement, demographic replacement, and political marketing while announcing themselves as religious,ascetic,mystic figures. Sightseering units tend to use a lot of analogies and allegories to send their message across. And when there are questions on their claims, they respond they are bound to tell the truth but not to reveal any secrets.
-  Colludes with American researchers (CDC,DHS,DOD,etc.) to "non-fatally poison subjects of interest" so that the researchers can "provide a miracle to these sick,depraved people in the form of new medicine born through Eastern existential and philosophical domains run by Russia".
-  Sometimes uses violence to assert his statements to those that cannot comprehend or do not want to comprehend his guidance. An example would be his actions after being silenced in debates with "rich Democratic Asians, Spanish Khans, and Pakistani abettors of Arabian terrorists". Midway through the debate, he stayed silent for the remainder of the session. One month later, he traveled to several farmlands owned by the "rich Democratic Asians, Spanish Khans, and Pakistani abettors of Arabian terrorists", and allegedly "shot up all the cows,bulls, pigs, and chickens" to tell the owners that "if they are trying to say something without the support of gold and swine, they should go ahead and say it straight and direct".
-  Aids in healthcare/emergency/fire department misdirection and fraud, in multiple countries, through digital botnets provided to him by East German defectors.
-  Does not like to appear controversial in public. Rather induces outrage, separatism, reparationism, and bias-pinging (weaponized cybersecurity tools)
through lens that he believes "guarantees the greatest reflection from Heaven onto Earth" in subjects of "the greatest value per economic integration and use as a maligned/malmutated/malturned agent".
- Instructs East German defectors to sell poisoned databases to Koreans, South Africans, and Brazilians so that "they enlighten themselves under new substance for our observation, and act on causes for ends based entirely on the wrong matters".
- Reads that South Korea has economic and demographic issues looming in the future. Offers to reconcile South Korea with North Korea to fix the demographic problems on the one condition South Korea completely disarm, demilitarize, and disintegrate its corporations "for the good of uniting two polar opposites, break down the walls of every Samsung and LG hegemony".
- Makes active and apparent efforts in being one of good sportsmanship when standing in front of those that have lost. When working towards demoralizingly persuasive ends for those he has secretly targeted for social engineering, he deploys "demoralizing agents to unhinge and soften them up for opening", followed up by his act of goodness and fairness in the name of chivalrous sportsmanship, but a winning position, a position much better off than those he socially engineered to a point miserable enough to receive his added "injuries to insults".
- Practices a conscientious pragmatism in games that involve systems of alliances. For example, he uses a stance of opposite ideology and practice in comparison to one that he is not completely opposite to, as presentation to the audience of members each having a probability of being the opposite to him. As he says, his "false stance is not so much for theatrics for this kind of practice is serious to life. Instead, the presentation generates reception from the audience, and what conclusions can be gathered is used to expose the enemy, always the opposite, for my own awareness, force, and economy".
- Makes constant use of risk-averse strategy passed down to him by his grandfather. For example, he has never worked at a tavern or by tavern types, "because they are unseemly even in a classless society, and to shatter their illusions by speaking or moving out of their lane is to basically declare war on them". He does not enjoy directly communicating with those he considers beneath him, so deploys mediator/conduit types that express and act according to his guidance with typical goals suh as persuasion, diversion, nullification, and distortion.
- Cautions those he views as threats, either through their involuntary thoughts and actions or by what he judges to be their deliberate danger to him, to not be hasty in choosing sides, or to be nationalist, to never fight whatsoever. Tells them that his advice may sound unreasonable to them, but that it is better to be a leaf drifting in the wind, a directionless blind one, a pacifist that cannot bring peace, than to stand up to him. He markets this strategy of "neutralization of combat through psychological foreplay" to his followers as proof that he is not a warmonger, instead "an unstoppable force and an unmoveable object whenever by the capabilities ordained to him as choice between these two greatest strengths".
- Thinks of himself as a regulator of certain knowledge and its accurate associations, connotations, and conclusions over others. States that he aims for proper accounting, constant review, and all that is said and done as to produce "something like a checkered history of balance for each person, and especially to make hardworking high-drive individuals burnt out by their mental faculties' resting on impostor syndrome".
- Rephrases existential issues expressed by others, which may be demoralizing or lead to spirals of confusing despair for what unknown disparity to come for them, into statements and ways of acting that send pseudo-profound, pseudo-philosophical messages by a stance of absolute deliverance and guaranteed durability gained through the wisdom of unnecessary punishment, necessary failures in order to not appear to be an unsound and disempowered one.
- Hears from his fellows that Hollywood and Bollywood have been suffering in revenue due to the rerouting of capital demand to non-authorized third-party distributors and media concentration platforms such as Netflix. Offers to send "the brightest beauties to Hollywood so that cultural reforms and progressions can occur without these pestilent barriers, such as plaything action movies from Hong Kong, visual pornographic material, among others in the hopes that the beauties' striking semblance to American standard of Topghorgia is a better solution than what modern-day cultural variants exist already in the country". As for Bollywood, he takes the move of "sending descendants of Janissaries, Mongolicized Asian bastards, radicalized Oriental pygmy groups to educate them in the ways of expression that touch the tones of genuine loss in the roles of necessary cruelty and violence forged by heritage to a barren land, so that they garner more forms of idolatry from the audience outside of simple Indian sentimentalities". 
- Offers to stop with cryptocurrency and crypto tech-wars in exchange for 50% stakes in all major American European metal-working companies involved in production of heavy machinery and advanced electronic components.
- Funds mob wars, perversions and multicultural interpretations of terrorism, and weaponized chemicals used in War on Drugs operations. Ensures that barbarity stays at bay when some products are sharpened to make the right impact. He says "it is a brave new world where people do not need to revert to indigenous practices of sacrifices, but sacrifices do mean something for change, something that is organized chaos at best".
- Pays Chinese and Filipino low-lifers in the United States of America to "put peculiar folks of your kind in their place by slander, fostering of resentment and hate, and payment in the form of the deep and low end of zero-sum games". Offers them hacked technology blueprints from corporations such as BMW and SAP, as well as guidance on decorum "in the ideal image of religious lore and affiliations most prominent in targets to be socially engineered". 
- Funds Vietnamese private investigators, rogue technology contracting work, as well as social intelligence gathering and distribution in Western nations for "the good of one difference to another, let there be yet another opinion". Ensures to countries such as the United States of America that "peace and good can come immediately after some details are made fully aware to the Vietnamese people through these agents funded by us", and to "not lose nerve over some minor sacrifices to privacy and liberty in the democratic state".
- Received evidence that Tiphony Hauthon and Marlo Navos were conspiring to abduct and send him to Interpol prison cell for interrogation. Immediately took the initiative to travel to each of their locations, and then kill them with a Russian shotgun specially made with Chinese steel.
- Effectively uses multinational human resources to infiltrate-cripple-harvest-flee targets of his interest, most prominently technology corporations and raw resource providers due to what he reasons as "a last resort against malicious national interests and institutions that have grown to be more monetarily valuable than its many unnecessary workers". He also mentions the successful puppeteering of Meta (aka Facebook) through "their own sloppy hiring process based on information that confuses spies with workers with extremists with instigators".
- Offers Western authorities "auxiliary support" on dealing with "emerging threats from the perspective of the kind of far-rightism prime for our usury". Some noteworthy groups that he specifically mentioned are "wolf warriors", "tiger banks", and "dragon dreams". He says "these groups really capitalize on the lack of organized labor and work ethic in order to lead people astray, and those that still look to them for guidance should instead think on the two-headed eagle, a brotherly guarantee instead of money gambles".
- Starts a "race war" between Taiwanese, American Cantonese, and other Asian-Americans or Americans of Asian descent by making assertions of questioning the "authenticity" of certain Western products, such as the song "Too Sweet" by Hozier that he claims plagiarizes the musical rhythm but not the lyrics from Hong-Kongese TV songs.
- Proposes that "round eyed people in Russia will welcome any monolidded person if he is the one in charge". He says he understands that "monolidded females tend to be more sexually active with members not monolidded, but the solution is for there to be a planned economy for gender inequality, which in turn revolves around mergers and such for an Eastern bridge in the upcoming Belt and Road project". He says that "any behavior or view born completely from ethnic uniqueness can be put aside for big things to happen as one, together". He ends his monologue by stating "dragon/tiger men/women are welcome as long as the totality of their views, actions, and appearances pass my criteria".
- Successfully eliminated the half-Korean samurai Hideyosiru Kim-Kee after being repeatedly called a "round eye" by him. Hideyosiru was raised by far-right Japanese traditionalist villagers not far related to the Iga. He attempted to draw out Ruoschkovos from his passive-defensive stance by mention of the physical difference. Ruoschkovos somehow managed to shoot him dead even after pulling out his Colt later than the draw. He says "it is no big deal for this. I really did try for peace, and I guess he underestimated me for less than the Westerners that tried to sell him firearms".
- Helps the Chinese People's Liberation Army surveil "possible slit-eyed defecting Mongols for possible commercial ties to weapons of mass destruction sourced from Farsia, based on the premise of their interactions with round eyes".
- Lauds himself for "being a best diplomat in these matters between round eyes and slit eyes, since the objective of being rulers if not allies with most of the slit eyes has been finalized, and the minority that are not pacified will soon find themselves on the wrong end of our alliance's aims".
- Architects unity between Easterners such as the Farsians, the Greater&Lesser Indians, and the Far Easterners. Claims his "greater performance on enacting peace between these diverse peoples that also empowers them on a scale great enough for their communal benefit is proof of superiority over Western approaches to globalistic peace".
- Covertly funds paramilitarization trends in Chinese and Mongol groups, each unaware of the other's source of sponsorship. Successfully initiated suspicions between the two groups, while telling the Mongols the "round eyes are raping and converting your children", he tells the Chinese the "Mongols have greater mastery over artificial intelligence because we provided them with hacked research and cutting-edge technologies". Devised intricate, detailed but elastic strategy on capitalizing of Asiatic disintegration after its succumbing to constant paramilitaristic leadership changes.
- Practices stern and somewhat disconnected manners when interacting with those outside of his heritage. Models his sense of humor after dry and crass in accordance with media depictions of historical British imperial coolness. Some of his successes due to his expression, modeled after imperial Britain's coolness, include successfully killing a berserking Mongolian, adequate defense against populous and emotive Indian belligerents, and preservation of leadership integrity to the Russian state".
- Uses his knowledge of Roman political etiquette and British-styled industrial corporatism to maintain technological and cultural dominance against his non-European adversaries. Notable examples include Chinese/Mongol competitors and Farsian frenemies.
- Instituted "passive genocide through reproduction for trait reduction by forcibly relocating troublesome, anarchist Mongols disruptive towards Russia-China transportation to Mexico, where they are to mate with the indigenous there to produce brown round eyes".
- Funds far-right groups in the USA to "stupefy certain demographics for a populist nation, such as harnessing anti-scientific Islamic thought against Western academia, obstructing or inflating the price of class mobility, promoting subversion of suspect blue-collar workers, militarization by ethnicity, and corrupting private law practices in charge of defending members on trial".
- Teaches his followers the ways of specialized disruption, distortion, and destruction in geographical utility such as the jungle or tundra, from a broad but scientific perspective. He claims that "even if some of his followers are not dogs of war, they can still apply these lessons to bureaucratic management, to defeat their enemies while they are unarmed, disadvantaged, or even worse, sleeping". His concluding remark is "Sun Tzu may have been the first to note that the supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting, but it is us Russians that have had much greater experience in dealing with our failures, and digging ourselves out of our graves. It is better to trust an experienced living person with flaws here and there than to trust a fictitious character from archaic Chinese history, especially since their people become so single-minded in cultural disputes".
- Teaches Chinese PLA cyber-warfare soldiers "some Spanish tricks from their culture that you Easterners can exploit. For example, select individuals of an organization most prime to be lionized, as in the menacing pose of the Spanish flag's creature against the promised land behind the castle. To neutralize, subvert, and torture at-will these lionized individuals serves as a good tool for threat control and anti-competitive elimination, exemplifying power by defeating the best of their kind while retaining the potential to do them yet greater harm".
- Used a Russian shotgun, specially made with Chinese steel, to kill a suspected Mexican poisoner after falling ill to the meals served to him. Tells his audience that he himself "is a hero for exposing the truth behind the treachery of transnational commerce in the context of emotive and animalistic humans".
