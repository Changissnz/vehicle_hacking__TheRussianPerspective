# The Russian Agent, Svletlano Ruoschkovos

The agent follows these steps to 
"hack" his target's vehicle.
- Collect geospatial information on 
vehicle through a channel available 
to him, that he thinks is accurate.
- Use available resources and known
methodologies to "hack the system":
air conditioning, radio, gps, 
bluetooth,electronic brake system, 
etc.
- Maintain connectivity to the exploit successfully enacted.
- Profit from exploits.

Some styles are preferred by Svletlano due to his background and present circumstances.
- Operates under the orders of his regime, such as by playing "Mr. Good Cop" or "Sir Liberator" to people at his mercy that have been oppressed and terrorized by his regime, in order to gather information on the targets and serve as a secret liability to them.
- Employs thugs, crooked cops, and paramilitary for accessories such as magic mushrooms, methamphetamine, cocktail death penalty drugs, firearms, and valuable information on the target/s.
- Employs the services of ex-military torturers, blond whores, and disenfranchised black people in the United States to "work towards Eastern imperial agenda".
- Presents himself as a soft-spoken sensible man with a knack for offering poetic advice and whisperings to those he targeted for seduction and infiltration, while harboring personal hatred that he outwardly expresses as diplomacy and friendship. Does not like to talk too much about politics and race, but when he is asked, he responds that he is a Marxist-Leninist.
- Frequently employs free-for-all and domination strategy. Track record of his success demonstrates cunning styles of gaits used to falsely befriend, compromise, and eliminate his targets as well as any of his involved allies that he assume to be liabilities.
- Architects race/resource wars between his different allies to pilfer power from them and redirect power from other channels to him. He does these things while playing the voice of reason, guardian of the peace, and bringer of eternal salvation.
- Tells people that ask him of his occupation that he is an office clerk so that they never suspect him to be the head of multi-billion dollar vehicle-hacking operations.
- Devotes more of his time during recent years on Red team hacking operations, and does not have the proper background knowledge to understand advanced technology. Rather plunders then purchases advanced technology for his personal engineers to enhance into weaponized forms.
- Constantly practices pop cultural conservative mannerisms in the mirror to blend in with foreign leadership, but enjoys activities such as philandering, hard drugs, and demon-worshipping.
- Makes up elaborate but identical fallacious stories to tell his many secret foreign fiances on how he obtained his narco-ballistic wealth.
- Practices foresight in developing plans to "siphon" his unusual forms of wealth, such as narco-ballistic wealth, into more civil malice such as "cybersecurity".
- Employs aggressive advertisers to market his "cybersecurity" en masse to automobile retailers. Adds services unit to perform cyber-retro enhancements on the older vehicles. Guarantees that products are real-time with solar-powered energy.
- Foments institutional idolatry to lure the prone and uncentered away from their pre-selected ideal paths, carefully tracks their progression in idolatry, and dissipates their wealth and social power when he sees fit, such as when he is desperate for resources, leaving them broken and delusional.
- Uses his national identity's rich history of "Nu Historicism", especially on the aspect of fabricated accounting, to really make a difference in cultural identities, ideologies, and perhaps other ethno-cultural aspects in countries that are geographically far from his homeland.
- Uses techniques such as paranoia induction (through over-surveillance, maladaptive/harmful human resources arrangements, etc.) and symbolic warfaring expressionism to maintain his grasp on his ever-expanding dominion.
- Maintains hegemony over Kompramatpopulizhei Krafschkatz, databases upon databases of compromising information on millions of people throughout the world, so as to etch the same horrors onto those he considers enemies, and applying that compromising information onto virtually everyone else as political leverage, a declaration of his influence that should very very seldom ever be questioned.
- Is open to using secretive forms of chemical warfare against those he classified as enemies, with aims ranging from maiming them, to drugging them, to harassing and stupefying them.
- Coordinates seriously terroristic messages, usually involving extortion or alarms of mass destruction, through his proxies in order to hold down socioeconomic competition and conserve his status as a powerful overlord.
- Oversees divisions between Maurya and Farsia, and enjoys chiming in as a bridge of diplomacy, in exchange to also be a benefactor of resources between the two regions.
- Prefers to maintain either a neutral or domineering position in BRICS trade arrangements that may be questionable by some organizations' standards.
- Uses the effects of the Arab Spring as a political opportunity to trade his employees as labor to Egyptians for their use of his provided internet-enabled technologies that may be completely radio-based. Places high emphasis on being the only supplier of militaristic technologies to certain Egyptians. Installs vulnerabilities in the systems, but says that it is for defense purposes in the cases of particular situations.
- Colludes with agents from the Permanent 5 members of UNSC, in order to ensure constant flow of wealth and health to his family members, a great fraction of them being aristocrats.
- Hires Russian domestic intelligentsia to collude with right-wing Western academics in conducting sociological research on demographics of curiosity, such as Arabia, Farsia, Maurya, and Indochina.
- Collaborates with East Germans and Muslim Turks to "kneecap" engineering and innovation in regions of potential competition, such as South China, Korea, Mexico, and the United Kingdom.
