# The Russian Agent, Svletlano Ruoschkovos

The agent follows these steps to 
"hack" his target's vehicle.
- Collect geospatial information on 
vehicle through a channel available 
to him, that he thinks is accurate.
- Use available resources and known
methodologies to "hack the system":
air conditioning, radio, gps, 
bluetooth,electronic brake system, 
etc.
- Maintain connectivity to the exploit
  successfully enacted.
- Profit from exploits.

Some styles are preferred by Svletlano due to his background and present circumstances.
- Operate under the orders of his regime, such as by playing "Mr. Good Cop" or "Sir Liberator" to people at his mercy that have been oppressed and terrorized by his regime, in order to gather information on the targets and serve as a secret liability to them.
