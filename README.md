# The Russian Agent, Svletlano Ruoschkovos

The agent follows these steps to 
"hack" his target's vehicle.
- Collect geospatial information on 
vehicle through a channel available 
to him, that he thinks is accurate.
- Use available resources and known
methodologies to "hack the system":
air conditioning, radio, gps, 
bluetooth,electronic brake system, 
etc.
- Maintain connectivity to the exploit successfully enacted.
- Profit from exploits.

Some styles are preferred by Svletlano due to his background and present circumstances.
- Operates under the orders of his regime, such as by playing "Mr. Good Cop" or "Sir Liberator" to people at his mercy that have been oppressed and terrorized by his regime, in order to gather information on the targets and serve as a secret liability to them.
- Employs thugs, crooked cops, and paramilitary for accessories such as magic mushrooms, methamphetamine, cocktail death penalty drugs, firearms, and valuable information on the target/s.
- Employs the services of ex-military torturers, blond whores, and disenfranchised black people in the United States to "work towards Eastern imperial agenda".
- Presents himself as a soft-spoken sensible man with a knack for offering poetic advice and whisperings to those he targeted for seduction and infiltration, while harboring personal hatred that he outwardly expresses as diplomacy and friendship. Does not like to talk too much about politics and race, but when he is asked, he responds that he is a Marxist-Leninist.
- Frequently employs free-for-all and domination strategy. Track record of his success demonstrates cunning styles of gaits used to falsely befriend, compromise, and eliminate his targets as well as any of his involved allies that he assume to be liabilities.
- Architects race/resource wars between his different allies to pilfer power from them and redirect power from other channels to him. He does these things while playing the voice of reason, guardian of the peace, and bringer of eternal salvation.
- Tells people that ask him of his occupation that he is an office clerk so that they never suspect him to be the head of multi-billion dollar vehicle-hacking operations.
- Devotes more of his time during recent years on Red team hacking operations, and does not have the proper background knowledge to understand advanced technology. Rather plunders then purchases advanced technology for his personal engineers to enhance into weaponized forms.
- Constantly practices pop cultural conservative mannerisms in the mirror to blend in with foreign leadership, but enjoys activities such as philandering, hard drugs, and demon-worshipping.
- Makes up elaborate but identical fallacious stories to tell his many secret foreign fiances on how he obtained his narco-ballistic wealth.
